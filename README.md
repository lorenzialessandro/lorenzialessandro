I am currently doing a **Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Systems** at the *University of Trento* (Italy), where I'm building advanced skills in AI-driven solutions, machine learning, and optimization.

I worked as an *IT consultant* specializing in digital transformation, where I led projects to modernize processes and developed custom management solutions tailored to client needs.

My background includes a *Bachelor's degree in Computer Science* from the University of Trento, providing a strong foundation in software development, data structures, and algorithms.
